# System-Analysis-and-design
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  The Client was a company called DriverPass.  They type of system that they wanted was for people to have access to 
  preparing themselves for their drivers exam.  They wanted the potential clients to be able to make reservations on line
  and or in person.  The packages would offer inperson ride alongs, or just on line test preparation.
What did you do particularly well?
  I listened to what the client's overall vision of the system.  I brought to life the clients expectations of what they wanted
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I think that I would select all of my dieagrams, like the activity diagram, and the sequence diagram.  I struggled a little bit with the 
  sequence diagram.  Eeven though in my mind I knew what I wanted the sequence to do, it was kind of hard for me to put it on paper.  
  But, I think with practice, I will become a better sequence diagram developer.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  The user is your customer.  You give them what they want.  They are paying for a service that you are providing them.  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  design documents for sure.  You need to have an understanding of why you are writing the document for the program;You need to know what to include in the design;You need 
  to understand how to structure you documentation;And finally, you need to understand the process that surrounds your document for your system.
